# Diabetic-Retinopathy
My work at the IIM, Bangalore during the summer of 2019
It includes all the python codes that I used to Preprocess and clean the data.
It also contains the Python code used to implement CNN for classifying images as the case of Diabetic Retinopathy.
Has three different implementation using SGD, ADAM and RMS Prop.
The resulting image is also there which tells the learning curve.
