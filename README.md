# Diabetic-Retinopathy
My work at the IIM, Bangalore during the summer of 2019
It includes all the python codes that I used to Preprocess and clean the data.
It also contains the Python code used to implement CNN for classifying images as the case of Diabetic Retinopathy.
Has three different implementation using SGD, ADAM and RMS Prop.
The level of accuracy achieved was around 78-80% and validation accuracy of around 75% with the classifier trained on the local eye hospital generated data.
